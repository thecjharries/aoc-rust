# Advent of Code Tooling

This repo holds a Rust crate to help with my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.

## Usage

Either add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aoc = { git = "https://github.com/thecjharries/aoc-rust", branch = "main" }
```

or from the command line:

```bash
cargo add --rename aoc --git "https://github.com/thecjharries/aoc-rust" --branch main
```
